# GeoTraceroute

[![Project Status: Concept â€“ Minimal or no implementation has been done yet, or the repository is only intended to be a limited example, demo, or proof-of-concept.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/concept.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#concept)

GeoTraceroute utilizes [traceroute](https://linux.die.net/man/8/traceroute), [globe.gl](https://globe.gl/) and [IPinfo.io](https://ipinfo.io/) to visualize the route/path to a host over the internet in real-time. This tool has only been tested thus far for Linux but working on adding Windows support in the future.
